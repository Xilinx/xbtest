********************************************************
Overview
********************************************************

xbtest comes with a set of pre-canned tests which use one or more of the available |test cases|.

The pre-canned tests can be used as templates to create your own tests.

Use command line option :option:`-h` to list and locate the pre-canned test files.
Any pre-canned test requires xbtest to be set up correctly (see :ref:`set-up-xbtest`).

.. warning::
    The exact list and content of available pre-canned tests is specific to each platform.
    The ``test_sequence`` used by these various tests depends on the targeted platform.

.. important::
    For each platform, all pre-canned tests have been validated in DELL PowerEdge R740 server with its fans spinning at 100% in a 25Â°C room.

xbtest supports the following pre-canned tests described in next sections:

.. note::
    The ``test_sequence`` listed in these various pre-canned sections is purely illustrative.
    Please refer to the actual pre-canned test of your platform for accurate parameter definitions.

********************************************************
``dma``
********************************************************

The ``dma`` pre-canned test performs a basic |DMA| test case of all memories available on the card (for example: DDR and/or HBM).
For more information about host <-> memory test capabilities, see :ref:`dma-test-case-description`.

All the GT_MAC CUs present in |xclbin| are referenced in this pre-canned test.

Here is an example of how a pre-canned ``test_sequence`` may look like.
Refer to the pre-canned test provided in the |Platform specific library| for accurate content.

.. code-block:: JSON

    "test_sequence": [

----

=====================================================
``switch``
=====================================================

The ``switch`` pre-canned tests require to be connected to a 10GbE or 25GbE switch port.
See :ref:`gt-mac-test-case-description` for supported test sequence, lane mapping, switch and cables.

These pre-canned tests perform basic tests at 10GbE or 25GbE rate while the GT is connected to a 10 or 25GbE switch port.
The traffic is looped back by the switch.
All the GT_MAC CUs present in |xclbin| are referenced in these pre-canned tests.
One pre-canned test is provided per lane rate:

  * **10GbE**: ``switch_10gbe``.
  * **25GbE**: ``switch_25gbe``.

Here is an example of how a pre-canned ``test_sequence`` may look like.
